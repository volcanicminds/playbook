## Why this playbook?

A business playbook is a collection of documents, processes, and guidelines that define how a company operates. It acts as a roadmap for employees, stakeholders, partners, and customers to comprehend our values and philosophy. Here are a few reasons why having a business playbook is crucial for us:

- Consistency: A business playbook ensures that everyone in the company is on the same page when it comes to quality, transparency, and customer satisfaction. It sets the standards and expectations for all employees to follow, ensuring that the company delivers consistent results to its clients.

- Clarity: A well-defined playbook provides clarity to employees, customers, and stakeholders about the company's policies, procedures, and guidelines. It eliminates confusion and miscommunication, ensuring that everyone knows what to expect from the company.

- Reputation: One of the missions of Volcanic Minds is to build a good reputation. A business playbook helps ensure that the company consistently delivers on its promises, which can help build trust with customers and improve its reputation.

- Efficiency: A business playbook can also improve the efficiency of the company's operations. By defining processes and procedures, employees can work more efficiently, reducing errors and improving productivity. This can lead to cost savings and improved profitability.

- Growth: A well-defined business playbook can help a company grow. By establishing a good reputation, the company is more likely to attract new customers and retain existing ones. This can lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities.

In conclusion, this business playbook is here to provide consistency, clarity, reputation, efficiency, and growth opportunities, which can help the company succeed in the long term.

## How frequently is this playbook updated?

This playbook is a living document that is constantly evolving to reflect the latest decisions and practices of the company. There is no one right time to update and review this document, but it is true that we consistently review it to reflect any business decisions in a timely manner.

## Who keeps this playbook up to date?

Whenever a new decision is made, whether it's by the leadership team or as a result of an employee suggestion that has been approved, the playbook will be updated accordingly. This ensures that the entire team is working from the same playbook and that everyone is aware of the latest policies and procedures. By keeping the playbook up-to-date, the company can operate more efficiently and effectively, as everyone is aligned with the same goals and strategies.

Additionally, employees are encouraged to provide suggestions and feedback to continuously improve the playbook, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective for the company's needs.

## Do you work on-site with partners and customers?

Every collaboration requires ceremonies, even in-person, to establish a strong and solid relationship. At Volcanic Minds, we have decided to work in an agile and remote way for various reasons, including costs, talent acquisition, work-life balance, market reach, and company strategy. While we maintain physical contact with our customers and partners when necessary, there is no doubt that our way of working leans heavily towards smart working methods.

## What tools do we often use?
