## A bit of history

As a young and dynamic company, Volcanic Minds is poised to make a significant impact on the IT consulting industry.

## Our values & experiences

At our company, we are incredibly passionate about our core values, which are the driving force behind everything we do.
Quality is not just a buzzword for us - it's the foundation of our business, and we always go the extra mile to ensure that our products and services exceed our clients' expectations.
Transparency is another value that we hold dear, as we believe in building strong, honest relationships with our clients and partners. We welcome honest opinions and feedback, as we know that this is what helps us grow and improve.
Our clients' needs are our top priority, and we take the time to understand their unique challenges so that we can deliver tailored solutions that meet their specific requirements.

With our extensive experience across a range of industries - including manufacturing, banking, finance, automotive, digital evolution and advertising - we bring a wealth of expertise and insights to every project. We are incredibly proud of our values and experiences, and we can't wait to share our passion with you!

## Vision and Mission vs Philosophy

Our vision is to achieve growth without ever sacrificing quality or losing focus on our clients' needs. We believe that by staying true to our core values, we can continue to expand while still delivering exceptional products and services.

Our mission is to create an environment where our employees can thrive both professionally and personally. We want our team to feel challenged and inspired in their work, while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We believe that happy and motivated employees are the key to our success, and we work hard to provide them with the resources and support they need to succeed.

Our philosophy is centered around innovation, creativity, and collaboration. We encourage our team to think outside the box and come up with new ideas that can help us better serve our clients and stay ahead of the curve. By fostering a culture of teamwork and open communication, we are able to achieve our goals while also creating a positive and supportive work environment.

## Company rituals & touch points

At Volcanic Minds, we place great importance on creating rituals and touchpoints that help us foster a strong sense of community and connection among our employees, especially being a _full remote_ company.

One of our key touchpoints is our regular team meetings, where we come together to discuss our progress, share updates, and brainstorm new ideas. We also hold training sessions and workshops to help our employees develop new skills and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Another important touchpoint for us is our social events, such as team building activities, happy hours, and company-wide celebrations, how important is to stay close from time to time, when we are so distant during the working hours! These events give our team members the opportunity to connect with one another on a more personal level and build stronger relationships.

In addition to these touchpoints, we also have a number of company rituals that help us reinforce our core values and promote a positive work culture. For example, we have a tradition of recognizing and celebrating employee achievements, and we always make sure to acknowledge and thank team members for their hard work and dedication.

These events play a crucial role in helping us build a strong and supportive company culture, and we are committed to continuing to invest in them in the years to come.
