## Effective meetings

To ensure effective meetings, it's crucial to establish rules that apply to everyone involved, including partners, clients, and coworkers.

Firstly, the meeting should follow specific etiquette, starting between 09:30 to 12:30 and 14:30 to 17:30. As a full remote company, attendees should always keep their cameras on during the meetings, and everyone should enter the meeting on time.
Only strictly necessary personnel should be invited; anyone who can be informed of the topics discussed by simply sending an email will not be invited but informed through the summary email.

Additionally, meetings should not exceed 50 minutes to prevent wasting attendees' time. To keep meetings concise, attendees should come prepared and well-informed about the topics beforehand.

Finally, it's essential to end each meeting by sharing established goals or a list of topics to discuss in future meetings. By following these guidelines, all attendees can ensure that their meetings are productive and efficient.
