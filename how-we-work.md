## Methodology

We offer a **project-based** approach to clients who want to engage our services for a specific project. This type of contract creates a legally binding agreement between the client and our company, which outlines the details of the project including the scope, timeline, and payment terms.

The project type contract serves as a comprehensive document that sets out the expectations and responsibilities of both parties, defining the roles and responsibilities of the company and the client. It ensures a clear vision of the project requirements, and it protects the interests of both parties.

We prefer **project-based** contracts because they give us the flexibility to plan and execute the project in a way that aligns with our client's goals. We see ourselves as partners and as true main actors in the project, not just service providers, and we work closely with our clients to define clear goals, milestones, and deliveries that ensure the project's success. This approach helps us build strong, long-term relationships with our clients and deliver high-quality work that meets their needs.

Another solution we offer is a **capacity-time-based** approach (not to be confused with a standard time and material contract) for clients who need flexibility in project requirements. With this method, the customer has access to a variable amount of our company's resources, which can be used at the most convenient times, such as during workload peaks or between project validation phases or when it is necessary to use external resources . We have some rules in place regarding how the client can allocate our time and what roles may be required, this approach can be a strong and viable alternative when the project is not fully clear or defined yet.

## Project steps

Managing a new IT project requires careful planning and execution to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the desired outcome. Here is how Volcanic Minds operates when dealing with a new IT project:

- Engage: This step involves engaging with the stakeholders and understanding their requirements, objectives, and goals for the project. The project manager should conduct in-depth documentation and analysis of the requirements, including gathering information on the scope of the project, the expected timeline, and the budget.

- Mockup: In this step, the project manager studies the target audience and creates a prototype of the project. This helps to identify any potential design or functionality issues and allows stakeholders to provide feedback on the project's design and features.

- Creation:
    - Management: Team management and performance evaluation is an essential step that involves managing the project team, assigning roles and responsibilities, setting goals and targets, and monitoring progress. The project manager should ensure that the team is working effectively and efficiently and address any issues that arise promptly.

    - Development: Infrastructure design and technical development involve designing and developing the technical aspects of the project, including the hardware, software, and network infrastructure. This step requires technical expertise and knowledge to ensure that the project is built to specification and meets the requirements of the stakeholders.

    - Sharing: Incremental sharing of the development progress and change request management involves sharing the progress of the project with stakeholders and addressing any change requests. The project manager should communicate regularly with stakeholders, provide progress reports, and seek feedback to ensure that the project is meeting the stakeholder's expectations.

- Evolution: Deployment, product evolution, generic, and release support is the final step in managing a new IT project. This step involves deploying the project, ensuring that it is working correctly, and providing support to stakeholders. The project manager should also ensure that the project is maintained and updated regularly to meet changing needs and requirements.

## Project meetings

Volcanic Minds, a software development company, utilizes the Scrum methodology to manage their projects. Scrum involves a set of meetings and rituals that enable the team to collaborate effectively and deliver value to their clients.

The Scrum process starts with sprint planning, during which the team meets to plan the work that will be completed during the upcoming sprint. The team reviews the product backlog, a prioritized list of features and requirements, and selects the items that they will work on during the sprint.

After sprint planning, the team holds daily scrum meetings, which are short stand-up meetings where each team member provides a brief update on their progress and discusses any issues or obstacles that they are facing. Daily scrum meetings help keep the team on track and ensure that everyone is aware of what others are working on.

At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review meeting, where they demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and receive feedback. The team then holds a sprint retrospective meeting to reflect on the previous sprint and identify areas for improvement in their process.

Overall, the Scrum methodology provides Volcanic Minds with a flexible and adaptive approach to project management that allows the team to work together effectively and deliver value to their clients on a regular basis.

## Effective meetings

To ensure effective meetings, it's crucial to establish rules that apply to everyone involved, including partners, clients, and coworkers.

Firstly, the meeting should follow specific etiquette, starting between 09:30 to 12:30 and 14:30 to 17:30. As a full remote company, attendees should always keep their cameras on during the meetings, and everyone should enter the meeting on time.
Only strictly necessary personnel should be invited; anyone who can be informed of the topics discussed by simply sending an email will not be invited but informed through the summary email.

Additionally, meetings should not exceed 50 minutes to prevent wasting attendees' time. To keep meetings concise, attendees should come prepared and well-informed about the topics beforehand.

Finally, it's essential to end each meeting by sharing established goals or a list of topics to discuss in future meetings. By following these guidelines, all attendees can ensure that their meetings are productive and efficient.

## Timesheet

At Volcanic Minds, we believe in trust and autonomy when it comes to managing workload. We do not require employees to fill out timesheets unless they are working on specific projects or clients that require dedicated tracking of time spent.

This policy allows employees to work efficiently without the added burden of tracking every minute of their time. However, for projects or clients that require dedicated tracking, we do require employees to fill out a timesheet. This helps us to accurately bill clients and monitor project progress.

We ask that employees communicate with their manager if they have any questions or concerns about tracking their time. Managers are available to provide guidance and support as needed.

While we understand that filling out timesheets can be a tedious task, we ask that employees take this responsibility seriously and complete their timesheets accurately and in a timely manner when required. This helps us to maintain our high standards of quality and efficiency as a company.
