## Career path

Volcanic Minds offers three main career paths: marketing and design, IT development, and administration and sales.

For the marketing and design area, there are two career paths: operatives and team leaders. Operatives work on specific projects, while team leaders manage a team of operatives. Each team could be assigned to specific clients or work on multiple projects simultaneously.

The IT development area is divided into sub-teams, each with a pool of frontend, backend, and quality developers and a team leader. The teams could work on specific projects, internal core projects, or multiple projects simultaneously.

The administration and sales area is divided into two sub-areas. The administrative sub-area handles all administrative work within the company, while the sales area has a 2-level structure with a team of salesmen and a team leader. Each team could be assigned to an industry, specific partners, or enterprise-level clients.

Each of the three main areas is led by one of the founders who acts as a strategy planner.

Overall, there are opportunities for growth within each career path, with the possibility of moving up from an operative to a team leader position, or from a team leader to a higher management position within the company.

As a small to mid-sized company, we recognize that career growth may not always follow a vertical path with clear promotions and titles. Instead, we believe in providing our employees with opportunities to take on additional responsibilities and expand their skill sets, which can lead to new and exciting career paths.

We encourage our employees to take on new challenges and seek out opportunities for growth within the company. By demonstrating a strong work ethic, a willingness to learn, and a commitment to the company's values and goals, employees can earn the trust and respect of the board and the company's founders.

## Smart working vs Remote working: hybrid

Volcanic Minds operates as a fully remote organization, which means that all of its employees work from home or any other location they choose. This approach has been adopted by the company because it believes in the importance of trust and efficiency in the workplace.

Volcanic Minds requires its employees to operate within a specific time zone range. Specifically, they ask that their employees work from within a time zone that is either one hour ahead or one hour behind the company's official time zone. This requirement ensures that employees are available for team collaboration and meetings during standard business hours, while also allowing for flexibility in work schedules.

By trusting its employees to work independently, the company has been able to create a flexible work environment that allows its team members to balance their personal and professional lives in a way that suits them best. This has resulted in increased job satisfaction, improved work-life balance, and higher productivity levels.

Despite being a fully remote company, Volcanic Minds recognizes that there may be occasions where face-to-face meetings and social activities are necessary. As such, the company is open to the possibility of organizing in-person meetings and social events in the future. This could include things like team building activities, training sessions, and company-wide celebrations.

In conclusion, Volcanic Minds is a forward-thinking company that recognizes the benefits of remote work. By fostering a culture of trust and efficiency, the company has created a dynamic and flexible work environment that allows its employees to thrive. While the company may consider introducing in-person meetings and events in the future, this decision will be made collaboratively and with the best interests of its employees in mind.

## Leave days, vacation days

Company vacation days are an important aspect of employee benefits that are designed to help employees achieve a healthy work-life balance. The law in many countries mandates a minimum number of days of paid leave per year, which employees are entitled to. At our company, we adhere to these legal requirements and ensure that our employees receive their entitled leave days.

However, we also understand that employees have different needs and preferences when it comes to taking time off from work. Therefore, we don't have mandatory vacation days during specific times of the year, such as a summer shutdown or a winter break. Instead, we encourage our employees to plan their time off in advance and work with their direct managers to ensure that the business needs are taken into account.

Transparency and flexibility are key principles that we follow when it comes to company vacation days. We encourage our employees to discuss their needs and preferences with their direct managers, and we work together to find solutions that meet both personal and business needs. We believe that this approach helps to create a positive work environment, where employees feel supported and valued.
