## Smart working vs Remote working: hybrid

Volcanic Minds operates as a fully remote organization, which means that all of its employees work from home or any other location they choose. This approach has been adopted by the company because it believes in the importance of trust and efficiency in the workplace.

Volcanic Minds requires its employees to operate within a specific time zone range. Specifically, they ask that their employees work from within a time zone that is either one hour ahead or one hour behind the company's official time zone. This requirement ensures that employees are available for team collaboration and meetings during standard business hours, while also allowing for flexibility in work schedules.

By trusting its employees to work independently, the company has been able to create a flexible work environment that allows its team members to balance their personal and professional lives in a way that suits them best. This has resulted in increased job satisfaction, improved work-life balance, and higher productivity levels.

Despite being a fully remote company, Volcanic Minds recognizes that there may be occasions where face-to-face meetings and social activities are necessary. As such, the company is open to the possibility of organizing in-person meetings and social events in the future. This could include things like team building activities, training sessions, and company-wide celebrations.

In conclusion, Volcanic Minds is a forward-thinking company that recognizes the benefits of remote work. By fostering a culture of trust and efficiency, the company has created a dynamic and flexible work environment that allows its employees to thrive. While the company may consider introducing in-person meetings and events in the future, this decision will be made collaboratively and with the best interests of its employees in mind.
