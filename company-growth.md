## Business evolution & future plan

[Work in progress]

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals

As you probably know, SMART is a mnemonic acronym that can be used to drive the main objectives which stands for ***S***_pecific_ ***M***_easurable_ ***A***_chievable_ ***R***_easonable_ ***T***_ime-bound_.

These are the goals we have set for the current year (2023):

- Increase sales by 25% by the end of Q4 through targeted marketing campaigns.

- Increase website traffic by 50% over the next months (max 6) through a combination of SEO strategies, social media advertising, and email marketing campaigns.

- Launch a new tailor-made service line dedicated to Corporate within the next 12 months, generating at least 15% of total earnings within the first year of launch.

- Identify and initiate at least one new social project to support in Q3 and Q4 periods.

- Conduct a study on the applicability of AI in our existing (open/closed) projects and explore opportunities for re-engineering them as white label services.

- Develop and implement a robust internship and stages program by the end of Q3 to attract and nurture top talent.

## Work for equity

Volcanic Minds, as a company, understands the value of equity for starting projects. However, at this stage in the company's life, it is not feasible to work only for equity for starting projects. The company's limited resources are primarily focused on developing its core business operations and expanding its customer base.

That being said, the company is open to evaluating opportunities for evolutionary or maintenance stages of projects. Volcanic Minds recognizes the potential benefits of equity arrangements in these stages, as they can provide a viable means of financing for companies with limited financial resources. The company is willing to explore these opportunities on a case-by-case basis and will work to ensure that any equity arrangements are mutually beneficial for all parties involved.

## Social projects & no-profit activities

We understand the importance of giving back a portion of our success for various reasons. Firstly, it helps to build a strong community around us. Secondly, contributing to social and non-profit activities allows us to use our expertise for the greater good (which is much needed). Lastly, it is an excellent way to motivate and raise awareness among our team members on topics that they may not be familiar with or confident in.

If you have any projects to propose, do not hesitate to write to us. We will evaluate them together. You can find more information on how to do so [here](/contact-us#how-to-ask-us-to-become-your-sponsor).
